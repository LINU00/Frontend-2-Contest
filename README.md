# 🚀 Startup Landing Page

This is my HTML + CSS project based on the provided Figma design. The webpage has four main sections:

📌 **Sticky Navbar** – Logo on the left, navigation links on the right. The navbar remains visible while scrolling.

👋 **Intro Section** – Includes a heading, lorem ipsum paragraph, and a button on the left. On the right, there’s an image of Jeff Bezos (exported from the Figma file).

✉️ **Contact Us Section** – Custom input fields with a clean look. When an input field is focused, no default blue outline appears (outline set to none).

📊 **Table Section** – A simple table designed according to the Figma file, with a footer created using the `<tfoot>` tag.

🖋️ **Styling** – The Montserrat font (Google Fonts) is used throughout the site. All styling matches the Figma UI as closely as possible.

✅ All requirements (sticky navbar, intro, contact form, table, Montserrat font, and accurate styling) are completed. The project is clean, responsive, and ready to deploy.
